# Industry Resilience Predictor
Our group decided to go the business track and used the Space Economy Data: 2012–2023 dataset, focusing on Table 2 (Space Economy Value Added by Industry) and Table 3 (Space Economy Value Added Price Indexes by Industry).
The project is an Industry Resilience Predictor which analyzes U.S. space economy data (2012–2023) to show how industries respond to shocks like COVID. Users can input a shock percentage to simulate future downturns, with forecasts and recovery paths based on past trends.
